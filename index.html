                        <p>Hi, I&#39m Rufus! I have a strong passion for problem-solving, which began during my university years when I developed complex real-world engineering solutions. This passion evolved into my first job as a business analyst and product manager. I have successfully contributed to the entire lifecycle of software products, from ideation to completion and want to continue this trend!</p>
